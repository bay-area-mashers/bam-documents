Bay Area Mashers Organizing Document

On this first day of January 1995, we do hereby form and establish the legal entity Bay Area Mashers. Our name is the Bay Area Mashers (BAM). This formation of BAM incorporates the March 2, 1993 Articles of Organization and the March 5, 1993 Mission Statement of the Bay Area Mashers Brew Club and all ammendments adopted by the club. Club membership is currently established at $20/year due and payable on July 1, 1995 and every twelve months thereafter. Upon dissolution of the club, all assets will be dispersed to the American Heart and Lung Association or other non-profit organization as agreed upon by member vote.

Any time the BAM announces a meeting in the monthly newsletter, a quorum will be deemed established at that meeting regardless of the attendance. The membership delegates that the President and/or the Executive Committee have the authority to make any and all administrative decisions on the behalf of BAM. This is stated especially with regard to payment of club expenses and the signing of contracts and/or agreements that BAM enters into. In the case that the club members do not agree with the direction or decisions of any club officer, they shall have the right to demand a vote of confidence. If 67% of the quorum express no confidence, then that officer shall step down and be replaced by a duly elected member.

Our club purpose remains that stated in the Mission Statement: The Bay Area Mashers Brew Club establishes itself to promote and foster the art and science of brewing quality beer in the home. Quality brewing depends on skillful application of procedure, creativity of purpose, and freshness and quality of raw ingredients. Toward this end, the club’s mission will embody the following Cannons:

    To provide technical advice through education and skill development in regard to beer styles, brewing techniques, and beer evaluation;
    To serve as a buying agent of the finest ingredients available, and make these goods available to all club members;
    To emphasize the use of All-Grain procedures, and encourage all members to develop these skills;
    To bring diverse people together, to promote both technical and social interactions;
    To hold regular monthly meetings to provide a forum for the interaction between members;
    To supply a monthly Newsletter to keep members informed about club events and other pertinent information;
    To run intra-club competitions to both aid in brewing better beers, and develop judging skills following the American Home brewers Association (AHA) and the Home Wine and Beer Trade Association standards established in the Beer Judge Certification Program;
    To encourage members to enter their beers in AHA sponsored competitions to both aid in beer evaluation, and to build the standing of the club within the home brewing community;
    To run all club business in accordance with the principles of democracy, with an elected Executive Committee (President, Treasurer, Editor, Technical Secretary, Social Secretary and Style of the Month Secretary) guiding the decision making process, with protocols established in the club’s Articles of Organization;
    To hold all members accountable to a general code of ethics and behavior, including, but not limited to, honesty, responsible drinking, and equitable contributions to the club.

        If the executive committee finds anyone in serious violation of our code of ethics they shall, to the best of their ability, take appropriate action (such as calling and paying fare for a cab for a driver too intoxicated to safely operate a motor vehicle) to protect the liability of the club and its members from any resulting legal action.

Article IX         Ethical Code:

    Excessive drinking is a hazard of the craft that brings us together. This is an undesirable and avoidable occurrence. Therefore, let it be resolved that no member shall drink to excess as defined by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Further let it be resolved that no member shall coerce, entice or otherwise willingly suffer such abusive consumption on the part of any other member.
    Honesty and respect are valued principles to any society and integral to the trust we put in our fellow members. No member shall steal, be violent or engage in behavior that is disrespectful to others or themselves.
    This club is as much a cooperative as it is an educational and social instrument. Our strength is dependent upon the individual contributions that members give to the club. Each member will endeavor to pull his own weight by paying dues on time and by doing chores in proportion to the net benefits they receive from the club.
